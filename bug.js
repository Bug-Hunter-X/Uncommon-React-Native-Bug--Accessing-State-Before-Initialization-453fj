This error occurs when you are trying to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when using functional components with useState hook and trying to access the state within the component before the component has fully mounted and the state has been set. For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    // Error: count is undefined if accessed here before render
    console.log(count); //Potential error here
    setCount(count + 1); 
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text> 
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
